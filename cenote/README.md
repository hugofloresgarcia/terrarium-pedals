# cenote - frequency-shifting chorus/delay + vibrato

## description

`cenote` is a frequency-shifting chorus/delay and vibrato pedal. It combines a delay with a frequency shifter and a vibrato effect, allowing you to create swirling, spiraling sounds that can be used in a variety of musical contexts.

`cenote` is a love letter to the OP-1's `cwo` effect, a frequency-shifting delay designed by Magnus Lidstr√∂m. unlike the `cwo`,  `cenote` features 4 toggle switches that create a variety of swirls and spirals when played with in a performative manner. plug the `cenote` after a looper, and play with the knobs and switches to create all kinds of textures! 


## controls


### knobs


### footswitches


### toggle switches

`cenote`'s 4 toggle switches change the operating ranges of the vibrato and delay, allowing you to create a wide range of effects. 

- `sw1` enables **extreme** vibrato, turning the vibrato depth all the way to 11, creating a wild, swirling effect.
- `sw2` enables the frequency shifter, allowing you to use the pedal as a standard delay or as a frequency-shifting delay spirals.
- `sw3` changes the delay time range. the bottom position operates more like a chorus, while the top position acts more like a delay. 
- `sw4` determines the direction of the frequency shift (when enabled), with options for both upward and downward shifting.

## some presets for you

## for nerds

On the inside, Cenote uses an [Electrosmith Daisy](https://electrosmith.com/) microcontroller as the brains, and a [PedalPCB Terrarium](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/pcb351/) as the hardware platform.

The code is open source! you can build one yourself or hack it yourself! see **TODO**
